All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in

The optimization to use `buffer.set_len(buffer.capacity())` in `command_helpers::StderrForwarder::forward_available`
doesn't look panic-safe: if `stderr.read` panics and that panic is caught by a caller of `forward_available`, then
the inner buffer of `StderrForwarder` will contain uninitialized data. This looks difficult to trigger in practice,
but I have opened an issue <https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs/issues/1036>.

`parallel::async_executor` contains `unsafe` pinning code but it looks reasonable. Similarly for the `unsafe`
initialization code in `parallel::job_token::JobTokenServer` and file operations in `parallel::stderr`.

This crate executes commands, and my review is likely not sufficient to detect subtle backdoors.
I did not review the use of library handles in the `com` package on Windows.

As noted in the changelog, this version produces different output for a given seed.
The documentation did not mention stability. It is possible that some uses relying on
determinism across the update would be broken.

The new constants do appear to match WyRand v4.2 (modulo ordering issues that I have not checked):

I have no way to check whether these constants are an improvement or not.
